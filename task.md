# Backend Developer - Work Sample
## Assignment
Your assignment is to develop a Product service using either Node.js or PHP. The service should store product data in some kind of database and expose *products* and *collections* through a simple API. We recommend that you use a framework for your application, but it's not required. Think of your work as a starting point for a bigger project, something that could be built upon by other developers in the future. Write the tests that you find suitable for this project.

## Requirements
### Data import
* The API should provide a PUT or POST endpoint to add new products from a JSON encoded list.
* A sample list of products is available in the `products.json` file.
### Products
* The API should have an endpoint returning a list of all products.
* The API should provide an endpoint returning detailed product information given a certain product ID.
* It should be possible to retrieve a list of IDs of all the products of the same size
### Collections
* The API should have an endpoint returning a list of all collections
* It should be possible to retrieve a list of IDs of all the products in the same collection

## Submission
Submit your application as a link to a git repository or a zip archive. Please add a README.md with information about your solution:
1. How do we build and run it?
2. What tools did you use?
3. Why did you use them?
4. Did you intentionally leave stuff out? In that case, what and why?

Feel free to use any tools you like to show us your skills.
